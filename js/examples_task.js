Its called induction.\n\nYour body, when you touch the antenna, becomes part of the antenna and can do 1 of 2 things. 1, it can help by removing and grounding out certain unneeded signals temporarily. By providing a path to ground, the EM frequencies are being grounded out and thereby eliminating interference by allowing the signals that you are trying to see, to be stronger than the ones you are trying to ignore. The 2nd thing, is that when you touch the antenna, your body extends the antennas surface area by a degree, and instead of the thin metal wires being the only conductors, it now uses you to catch and route signal to the antenna.\n\nIn essence, either way, when you touch it you become part of the conductor itself.",

When the antenna is held in the hand, it is able to move and adjust its position, which can help to improve the quality of the signal being received. This is because the antenna is able to more effectively \"point\" towards the broadcast tower, which can lead to a stronger signal and improved reception. Additionally, the movement of the antenna can help to eliminate any interference that may be present in the signal.",

This means that more of the antenna's signal can be received by the hand, resulting in improved reception.\n Question: How does the surface area of the antenna affect its reception?\n Answer: The surface area of the antenna affects its reception by determining how much of the antenna's signal can be received by the hand. The greater the surface area, the more of the antenna's signal can be received, resulting in improved reception.\n",
